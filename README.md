# movies-review-system
Developed a web application that allows users to explore movie information and submit reviews for their favorite movies. Utilized React for the frontend, Spring Boot for the backend, and MongoDB for data storage.

Key Features:

Movie Data Retrieval: Implemented functionality to fetch movie details including title, poster, and other information via RESTful API calls to a Spring Boot backend.

User Reviews: Designed a user-friendly review submission form that allows users to add their thoughts and opinions about movies. The reviews are then stored in a database.

Responsive UI: Created a responsive user interface using React Bootstrap components to ensure a consistent and visually appealing experience across devices.

Review Listing: Displayed user-submitted reviews for each movie dynamically, providing a space for users to read and contribute to discussions.

CORS Handling: Configured Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to enable secure data exchange between the React frontend and Spring Boot backend.

State Management: Effectively managed application state with React's useState and useEffect hooks to provide a seamless user experience.

Database Integration: Utilized MongoDB as the database for storing movie reviews and incorporated data retrieval and storage into the application.
